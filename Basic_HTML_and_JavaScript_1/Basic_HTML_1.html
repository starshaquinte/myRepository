      colors. The fiery reds and oranges gradually gave way to softer pinks and purples
      as the sun dipped below the horizon.</font>
      <font color="blue" size="7">The wispy clouds caught the light and appeared to be fire, casting long shadows
      across the landscape.</font>

	The trees and fields below were bathed in a warm golden glow.

      <p><b>The glow faded to blue as the darkness of night crept in.</b><i>The last remnants of light disappeared.</i><u>The stars emerged like tiny pinpricks in the deep blue canvas.</u>
