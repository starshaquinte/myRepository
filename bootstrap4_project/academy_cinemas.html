          <h4>Kong Skull Island</h4>
          <p>Scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical,
            uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Cut off from everything they know,
            they venture into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate
            battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery soon becomes
            one of survival, they must fight to escape from a primal world where humanity
            does not belong.</p>

          <h4>Ghost in the Shell</h4>
          <p>In the near future, Major is the first of her kind: a human who is cyber-enhanced
             to be a perfect soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals. 
             When terrorism reaches a new level that includes the ability to hack into people's 
             minds and control them, Major is uniquely qualified to stop it. As she prepares to 
             face a new enemy, Major discovers that her life was stolen instead of saved. Now, 
             she will stop at nothing to recover her past while punishing those who did this to her.</p>

          <h4>Beauty and the Beast</h4>
          <p>An arrogant prince is cursed to live as a terrifying beast until he finds true love.
             Strangely, his chance comes when he captures an unwary clockmaker, whose place is then
             taken by his bold and beautiful daughter Belle. Helped by the Beast's similarly enchanted
             servants, including a clock, a teapot and a candelabra, Belle begins to see the sensitive
             soul behind the fearsome facade. But as time runs out, it soon becomes obvious that Belle's
             cocky suitor Gaston is the real beast of the piece.</p>
